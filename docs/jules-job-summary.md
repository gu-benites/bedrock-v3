# Implementation Summary for Jules

This document catalogs the steps taken to refactor the authentication and state management of the PassForge application, based on the plan in `docs/implementation-consultant.md`.

## Phase 1: Refactor Core Auth State Management (useAuth Hook)

*   **[x] Task 1.1: Create `AuthSessionProvider` (React Context)**
    *   Created `src/providers/auth-session-provider.tsx`.
    *   Implemented as a Client Component (`'use client'`).
    *   Uses Supabase browser client (`@/lib/supabase/client`) and `onAuthStateChange` listener.
    *   Provides raw Supabase `User` object, `isLoading` state (for initial session check), and `error` state via React Context. The client instantiation is memoized using `useState`.

*   **[x] Task 1.2: Update Root Layout**
    *   Modified `src/app/layout.tsx`.
    *   The old Zustand-based `AuthStateProvider` was removed.
    *   Wrapped the application with the new `AuthSessionProvider` (from `src/providers/`).

*   **[x] Task 1.3: Create Service and Query for User Profile**
    *   Created `src/features/user-profile/schemas/profile.schema.ts` defining `UserProfileSchema` and `UserProfile` type (with fields like id, email, firstName, lastName, role, subscription details, etc., matching the provided database schema).
    *   Created `src/features/user-profile/services/profile.service.ts` with `getProfileByUserId` function to fetch and merge profile data from a `profiles` table and `auth.users`. This is a server-side service.
    *   Created `src/features/user-profile/queries/profile.queries.ts` with `getCurrentUserProfile` Server Action that calls `getProfileByUserId`.

*   **[x] Task 1.4: Create `useUserProfileQuery` Hook**
    *   Created `src/features/user-profile/hooks/use-user-profile-query.ts`.
    *   Implemented as a client-side hook using TanStack Query's `useQuery`.
    *   `queryKey`: `['userProfile', userId]`.
    *   `queryFn`: `getCurrentUserProfile` Server Action.
    *   Handles `enabled` state based on user authentication.
    *   Created `src/features/user-profile/hooks/index.ts` to export the hook.

*   **[x] Task 1.5: Create the New `useAuth` Hook**
    *   Created `src/features/auth/hooks/use-auth.ts`.
    *   Implemented as a client-side hook.
    *   Consumes `AuthSessionContext` (via `useAuthSession`) for raw `user`, session `isLoading`, and `sessionError`.
    *   Calls `useUserProfileQuery` for `profile` data.
    *   Combines states: `user`, `profile`, `authUser`, a stricter `isAuthenticated` (session AND profile loaded), `isLoadingAuth` (composite), `isSessionLoading`, `sessionError`, `isProfileLoading`, `profileError`.
    *   Updated `src/features/auth/hooks/index.ts` to export the new `useAuth`.

*   **[x] Task 1.6: Refactor Zustand Store (`useAuthStore`)**
    *   Modified `src/stores/auth.store.ts`.
    *   Removed core auth-related state and logic (`user`, `profile`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `error`, `initializeAuthListener`, old `useAuth` hook).
    *   The store is now a minimal placeholder for potential future non-auth global client-side state (e.g., `GlobalSettingsState` example added).

*   **[x] Task 1.7: Update Components Using Auth State**
    *   Updated `src/features/homepage/components/hero-header/hero-header.tsx` (and `mobile-menu.tsx`) to use the new `useAuth` hook from `@/features/auth/hooks`.
    *   Updated `src/features/auth/components/reset-password-form.tsx` to use the new `useAuth` hook for session validation, particularly `isSessionLoading`, `user`, and `sessionError`.

## Phase 2: Implement TanStack Query for Data Fetching (General)

*   **[x] Task 2.1: Setup `QueryClientProvider`**
    *   `src/providers/query-client-provider.tsx` (moved from `src/components/providers/`) correctly initializes `QueryClient` using `React.useState` and includes `ReactQueryDevtools`.
    *   `src/app/layout.tsx` correctly wraps the application with `QueryClientProvider`.

*   **[x] Task 2.2: Review Existing Data Fetching**
    *   The primary user-related data fetching (profile) has been migrated to TanStack Query via `useUserProfileQuery`.

## Phase 3: Code Cleanup and Documentation Update

*   **[x] Task 3.1: Remove Redundant Code**
    *   `src/components/providers/auth-state-provider.tsx` was marked for deletion and user confirmed deletion.
    *   `src/stores/auth.store.ts` was refactored as planned.
    *   The `src/components/providers/` directory was marked for deletion after its contents were moved to `src/providers/`.

*   **[x] Task 3.2: Update Project Documentation**
    *   This task has been completed. The documentation files in `/docs` (`project-overview.md`, `integrating-state-and-data-fetching.md`, `supabase-client-deep-dive.md`, `adding-new-features.md`) have been updated to reflect all architectural changes.

## Phase 4: Testing

*   **[ ] Task 4.1: Thoroughly Test Authentication Flows** (User is performing ongoing testing)
*   **[ ] Task 4.2: Test Data Fetching with TanStack Query** (Implicitly tested with profile fetching)

---
*This summary reflects the state of work after the implementation of the consultant's plan and subsequent refinements. All core architectural changes from `docs/implementation-consultant.md` are now in place.*
