# Task List Management

### Important Constraints:
- FIRST OF ALL - STUDY AND ANALYZE ALL THE FILES INVOLVED IN THE TASK LIST BEFORE YOU START WORKING ON IT.
- **DO NOT USE YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE REGARDING OPENAI, VERCEL. ONLY INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE TASK LIST SHOULD BE USED AND ANALYZED BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY WORKING, WE ARE JUST MIGRATING. THIS IS JUST REGARDING AI STREAMING AND CALLS TO THE API. OPENAI AGENTS JS SDK IS NEW FROM APRIL 2025 AND YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT BESIDES THE ONE I AM GIVING IT NOW. **

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

### **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next parent task until you ask the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y" after you finish all subttasks under the current parent task.
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
- Stop after each parent task and wait for the user’s go‑ahead.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
