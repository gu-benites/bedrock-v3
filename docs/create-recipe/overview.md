AromaChat Recipe Creator Analysis
1. Complete User Journey
The recipe creator implements a multi-step flow to create personalized essential oil recipes:

Step 1: Health Concern Input
Component: RecipeGenerator.tsx
User Input: Health concern description
Validation: Zod schema (healthConcernSchema) with minimum 3 characters
Transition: On form submission, stores health concern in context and redirects to /create-recipe/demographics
Data Preservation: Stores

Step 2: Demographics
User Input: Gender, age category, specific age
Validation: Form validation
Transition: On submission, makes API call to fetch potential causes
Data Preservation: Updates with demographics data

Step 3: Causes Selection
User Input: Selection from API-provided potential causes
API Integration: Receives causes from previous API call
Transition: On submission, makes API call to fetch potential symptoms
Data Preservation: Stores selected causes 

Step 4: Symptoms Selection
User Input: Selection from API-provided potential symptoms
API Integration: Receives symptoms from previous API call
Transition: On submission, makes API call to fetch therapeutic properties
Data Preservation: Stores selected symptoms

Step 5: Therapeutic Properties
Display: Shows therapeutic properties from API
API Integration: Receives properties from previous API call
Transition: Automatically proceeds to fetch suggested oils for each property
Data Preservation: Stores properties

Step 6: Essential Oil Suggestions
Display: Shows suggested oils for each therapeutic property
API Integration: Makes multiple API calls to get suggested oils for each property
Data Preservation: Stores suggested oils in context and sessionStorage

Step 7: [will be implemented after previous steps are working already]

2. Recommended Implementation Approach
I recommend implementing a Wizard Pattern with React Hook Form and Zustand. This approach combines the best aspects of several alternatives while addressing the specific challenges of this application.

Why This Approach?
This hybrid approach offers:

Simplified State Management: Zustand provides a lightweight, hook-based store that's easier to maintain than Context API
Optimized Form Handling: React Hook Form reduces re-renders and provides built-in validation
Persistence: Zustand can easily integrate with persistence libraries
Developer Experience: Both libraries have minimal boilerplate and intuitive APIs
Performance: Both are optimized for React's rendering model

Key Benefits of This Approach
Simplified State Management
Zustand provides a single source of truth without Context API boilerplate
Automatic persistence with the persist middleware
Easy debugging with Redux DevTools compatibility
Form Handling Improvements
React Hook Form reduces re-renders with uncontrolled components
Built-in validation with Zod integration
Field-level validation and error messages
Navigation Control
The useRecipeStepNavigation hook provides centralized navigation logic
Prevents users from accessing steps without required data
Supports both linear and non-linear navigation
Performance Optimizations
Minimal re-renders with React Hook Form
Zustand's selective updates only re-render affected components
Suspense boundaries for code splitting
Developer Experience
Intuitive API with hooks
Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux or Context
Type safety throughout with TypeScript
This approach addresses the specific challenges identified in the analysis while providing a maintainable, scalable solution that balances performance and developer experience.

3. Technical Architecture
Multi-Step Implementation
Routing: Uses Next.js dynamic routes (/src/app/dashboard/create-recipe/[step])
Components: /src/features/create-recipe/**
Transitions: Managed through router navigation

Backend Proxy Implementation
Endpoint: /src/app/api/create-recipe/route.ts serves as proxy to external API
Security: Stores API key on server-side to avoid exposing in client code
Request Flow:
Client calls internal service function
Service constructs payload and calls internal proxy endpoint
Proxy adds API key and forwards to external API
Response returns through same chain


Frontend Initiates Request: The frontend (UI components) does not call external third-party APIs directly. Instead, it interacts with your application's backend layer, typically via Server Actions (src/features/{feature_name}/actions.ts) for mutations or React Query hooks (src/features/{feature_name}/queries/) which internally call Server Actions or potentially your own API Routes (src/app/api/) for data fetching

Data Transformation
Each step transforms data for the next API call
Accumulates data from previous steps
Formats responses for UI presentation

Error Handling Strategy
Implement error boundaries at the layout level
Add specific error handling for API calls
Provide user-friendly error messages and recovery options
Log detailed errors for debugging

5. Implementation Challenges
Complex State Management
Challenge: Maintaining large state object across multiple steps

Performance Considerations
Challenge: Multiple concurrent API calls in the oils suggestion step

User Experience Continuity
Challenge: Maintaining context when users navigate back/forward
Solution: Implement a breadcrumb navigation system and allow non-linear navigation when data is available

Data Validation
Challenge: Ensuring consistent validation across steps
Solution: Create a centralized validation schema
