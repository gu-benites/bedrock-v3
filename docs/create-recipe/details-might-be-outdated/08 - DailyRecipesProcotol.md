### **Step 07: `DailyRecipesProcotol`**

This final step is now more focused. Its job is not to choose oils, but to take the pre-selected oils and build the detailed, user-facing protocol.

* *   **Persona:** Act as an Aromatherapy Protocol Designer. Your expertise is in application methods, safe dilutions, and creating easy-to-follow, time-of-day specific instructions.
* *   **Input:*** *   The `final_selected_oils` object.
*     * *   The original user `health_concern` for context and all previous selected items by the user.
* *   **Objective:** To arrange the provided list of final oils into a coherent daily protocol (Morning, Day, Night) with explicit (Aromatic, Topical and Ingestion), safe usage instructions.
* *   **Logic:**1. 1.  **Energetic Categorization:** Review the small list of selected oils and classify them as Stimulating, Calming, or Neutral.
*     1. 2.  **Protocol Arrangement:** Assign the oils to the Morning, Daytime, and Night recipes based on their energetic properties.
*     1. 3.  **Instruction & Dilution Formulation:** For each of the recipes:* *   Define the blend (e.g., "X drop Lemon, X drop Frankincense").
*     1.     * *   Specify the carrier oil and the final, safe dilution percentage, ensuring it respects the `recommended dilution` for every oil in the blend.
*     1.     * *   Provide clear application instructions (e.g., "Apply to the back of the neck and shoulders").
*     1.     * *   Include any necessary warnings derived from the `safety_profile`, such as a phototoxicity warning for any blend containing Lemon (phototoxicity oils).
* *   **Output:** The final, complete protocol ready for the user in a JSON Structured Format.

### The Need for a Holistic View

This is the most critical reason. To create a truly effective and balanced daily protocol, the AI needs a complete, holistic view of the entire day.

* *   **Balancing Oil Exposure:** If you create the "Morning Recipe" in isolation, it might select Frankincense and Lemon. If you then create the "Night Recipe" in a separate step, it might also select Frankincense and Lavender. The result is a protocol that uses Frankincense twice. A single, holistic step can make a more intelligent choice, deciding to use Frankincense in the morning and a different, complementary oil (like Vetiver) at night to ensure variety and balance.
* *   **Synergy Across the Day:** The AI can create a more elegant protocol if it sees the full picture. It can design the morning blend to "set up" the effects of the daytime blend, and the daytime blend to transition smoothly into the calming night blend. This level of synergy is lost if each recipe is created in a vacuum.
