### Notes

- Performance optimizations should maintain existing functionality while improving user experience
- All changes should be thoroughly tested to ensure no regression in AI streaming workflow
- Use `npm run dev` to test development performance improvements
- Use `npm run build && npm run start` to test production performance
- Run tests with `npx jest src/features/create-recipe` to verify functionality

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Verify Performance Optimizations Implementation
  - [ ] 1.1 Confirm Turbopack is enabled and working in development mode
  - [ ] 1.2 Verify Sentry is disabled in development and enabled in production
