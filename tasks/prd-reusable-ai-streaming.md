# PRD: Reusable AI Streaming Infrastructure

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements a reusable streaming infrastructure for OpenAI Agents JS SDK that replaces static loading messages with real-time AI response streaming. The primary goal is to enhance user experience during AI processing by providing immediate feedback and progress indication, while creating reusable business logic that any feature can integrate.

**Problem Solved:** Currently, users see static "Loading..." messages during AI processing (e.g., "Loading potential causes...") with no indication of progress or AI thinking process. This creates poor user experience during potentially long AI operations.

**Goal:** Create a reusable streaming solution that provides real-time AI response feedback while maintaining feature-specific UI flexibility.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Static Loading States:** Replace all static "Loading..." messages with real-time streaming AI responses
2. **Create Reusable Infrastructure:** Build streaming hooks and utilities that any feature can use
3. **Maintain UI Flexibility:** Allow each feature to implement custom streaming presentation
4. **Preserve Existing Architecture:** Maintain compatibility with current YAML prompt management and error handling
5. **Enhance User Experience:** Provide immediate feedback during AI processing operations

## User Stories

**As a Recipe Wizard user:**
- I want to see real-time AI analysis progress when generating potential causes
- I want to understand what the AI is thinking during processing
- I want immediate feedback that my request is being processed
- I want to see streaming text that builds up the final analysis

**As a developer:**
- I want to easily integrate streaming AI responses into any feature
- I want reusable hooks and utilities for OpenAI Agents JS SDK streaming
- I want to maintain existing error handling and validation patterns
- I want to create feature-specific UI without rebuilding streaming logic

**As a future chat feature user:**
- I want to see AI responses appear in real-time as they're generated
- I want typing indicators and progressive message building
- I want smooth, responsive chat interactions

## Functional Requirements

### Core Streaming Infrastructure

1. **The system must provide a reusable `useAIStreaming<T>()` hook** that handles:
   - Real-time text accumulation from stream chunks
   - Generic type support for different AI response formats
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Completion status tracking
   - SSE connection management

2. **The system must provide streaming utilities** (`stream-helpers.ts`) that handle:
   - SSE connection setup and management
   - Stream event parsing and transformation
   - Error handling utilities
   - Response format validation

3. **The system must provide a generic streaming API route** (`/api/ai/streaming`) that:
   - Accepts feature-agnostic requests with feature/step/data structure
   - Uses OpenAI Agents JS SDK streaming patterns exclusively
   - Returns Server-Sent Events (SSE) for browser compatibility
   - Maintains compatibility with existing YAML prompt management

### Recipe Wizard Integration

4. **The system must update the potential causes component** to:
   - Replace static loading with real-time streaming text display
   - Show AI analysis progress as it happens
   - Maintain existing error handling and validation
   - Preserve all current functionality and user flows

### Technical Requirements

6. **The system must use only documented OpenAI Agents JS SDK patterns** from:
   - `docs/openai-agents-js/content/guides/streaming.mdx`
   - `docs/openai-agents-js/examples/docs/streaming/*.ts`
   - `docs/openai-agents-js/examples/agent-patterns/streamed.ts`

7. **The system must implement proper SSE handling** with:
   - Browser-compatible streaming (not Node.js streams)
   - Proper connection management and cleanup
   - Error handling for connection failures

8. **The system must maintain existing architecture patterns** including:
   - YAML-based prompt management
   - Current error logging and handling
   - Test-first development methodology
   - Existing store patterns and state management

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Generic UI Components:** No reusable streaming display components (each feature handles its own UI)
2. **WebSocket Implementation:** Using SSE only, not WebSockets
3. **Real-time Collaboration:** Not implementing multi-user streaming features
4. **Voice/Audio Streaming:** Text-only streaming implementation
5. **Breaking Changes:** No modifications to existing non-streaming functionality
6. **Custom OpenAI Integration:** Using only documented SDK patterns, no custom API calls

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Progressive Text Display:** Streaming text should appear smoothly without jarring updates
- **Typing Indicators:** Visual cues that AI is actively processing
- **Error States:** Clear error messaging with retry options
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Streaming UI must work on mobile devices (90% of Recipe Wizard users)

### Component Architecture
- **Feature-Specific UI:** Each feature implements its own streaming presentation
- **Recipe Wizard:** Custom analysis display with cause selection integration
- **Future Features:** Chat bubbles, tables, cards, or other layouts as needed

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **OpenAI Agents JS SDK:** Must use documented streaming patterns only
- **Server-Sent Events:** Browser-native SSE support
- **React Hooks:** Custom hooks for state management
- **TypeScript:** Full type safety for streaming responses

### Integration Points
- **Existing YAML Prompts:** Must work with current prompt management system
- **Recipe Wizard Store:** Integration with existing Zustand store patterns
- **Error Handling:** Compatibility with current Winston logging and Sentry reporting
- **Testing Framework:** Jest/React Testing Library for comprehensive test coverage

### Performance Considerations
- **Connection Management:** Proper SSE connection cleanup
- **Memory Usage:** Efficient text accumulation without memory leaks
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of connection failures and retries

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
1. **Reduced Perceived Wait Time:** Users report faster perceived response times during AI processing
2. **Increased Engagement:** Users stay on page during AI processing instead of navigating away
3. **Error Recovery:** 95% success rate for streaming connection recovery after failures

### Technical Metrics
1. **Test Coverage:** 100% test coverage for new streaming infrastructure
2. **Performance:** No degradation in AI response times compared to non-streaming
3. **Reliability:** 99.9% successful streaming connection establishment
4. **Compatibility:** Zero breaking changes to existing Recipe Wizard functionality

### Developer Experience Metrics
1. **Reusability:** New features can integrate streaming in <2 hours of development time
2. **Documentation:** Complete documentation enables junior developers to implement streaming
3. **Maintainability:** Clear separation between reusable logic and feature-specific UI

## Open Questions

1. **Feature Flag Implementation:** Should we implement a feature flag system to toggle between streaming and non-streaming modes during rollout? NO

2. **Error Retry Strategy:** What should be the retry logic for failed streaming connections? (e.g., exponential backoff, maximum retry attempts)  Exponential backoff with maximum 3 retry attempts.

3. **Connection Timeout:** What timeout values should we use for SSE connections to balance user experience and server resources? 30 seconds

4. **Fallback Strategy:** If streaming fails, should we automatically fall back to non-streaming API calls? No, it will work.

5. **Analytics Integration:** Should we track streaming performance metrics (connection time, chunk delivery speed, etc.) for monitoring? No, it will work.

6. **Mobile Optimization:** Are there specific mobile considerations for SSE connections that we should address? No, it will work.

7. **Rate Limiting:** Should the streaming API have different rate limiting compared to non-streaming endpoints? No, same as non-streaming.

8. **Caching Strategy:** How should we handle caching for streaming vs non-streaming responses? We will not cache streaming responses.

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (High Priority):**
- Reusable streaming infrastructure (`useAIStreaming`, `stream-helpers`)
- Generic streaming API route (`/api/ai/streaming`)

**Phase 2 (Medium Priority):**
- Recipe Wizard potential causes streaming integration
- Comprehensive testing and error handling

**Phase 3 (Low Priority):**
- Documentation and developer guides
- Performance optimization and monitoring

This PRD provides a clear roadmap for implementing reusable AI streaming infrastructure while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse feature requirements.
