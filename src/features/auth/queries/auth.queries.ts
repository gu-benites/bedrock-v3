/*
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';

/**
 * Retrieves the currently authenticated user's data.
 * This is a Server Action that can be called from client components
 * (e.g., via TanStack Query's `queryFn`).
 *
 * @returns {Promise<User | null>} A promise that resolves to the Supabase User object or null if not authenticated.
 * @throws {Error} If there's an issue fetching the user from Supabase.
